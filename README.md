# LaTeX Template

LaTeX article, report and beamer template for my own simple writing.

Files in folder `native-tex` is the general LaTeX templates, which includes article, report, and slides.

In the main folder, the template `md-article` and `md-slides` are powered by package [markdown](https://github.com/witiko/markdown), which means you can **write Markdown in LaTeX**, That's really nice and recommended at the moment.
