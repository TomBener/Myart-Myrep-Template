# LaTeX Template

LaTeX article, report and beamer template for simple writing.

Files in folder `native-tex` are the general LaTeX templates, where the article, report, and slides are included.

In the main folder, the template `md-article` and `md-slides` are powered by the package [markdown](https://github.com/witiko/markdown), which makes it possible to **write Markdown in LaTeX**! With this workflow, you can integrate the simplicity of Markdown and the preciseness of LaTeX. As a result, it's really nice and recommended at the moment! 😏
